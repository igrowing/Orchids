<p>Orchids have very specific profile for best growth and blossom.
Often orchid owners treat these plants in wrong manner, driven by lack of knowledge, stereotypes, or common social opinion.
As results, many orchids are killed including very rare specimens.</p>
So far, the market does not provide all-in-one reasonable solution for orchid care.
This project comes to satisfy the demand of automatically controlled proper conditions for orchids.
